The Network Intelligence and Security Laboratory, established in January 2018, focuses on fundamental theoretical research and key technological development in areas including the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless communication systems and security, passive wireless systems, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, network and system security, data mining and intelligent recommendation, as well as intelligent video analytics. The team also undertakes the design and implementation of related systems.

The research team consists of one professor, one associate professor, one assistant researcher, two postdoctoral researchers, and over 30 master's and doctoral students. Over the past five years, the team has successfully led and participated in numerous national-level projects, such as those funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), National Key Research and Development Program, National High-Tech Research and Development Program (863 Program), and National Science and Technology Support Program. Research activities span cutting-edge topics including passive wireless sensing IoT systems, wireless embedded systems, and intelligent information processing.

The team has achieved significant academic contributions, publishing more than 200 papers in renowned international journals and premier academic conferences, including ACM and IEEE transactions. Currently, the team operates a dedicated laboratory of approximately 160 square meters, equipped with advanced research instrumentation, comprehensive R&D equipment, and a wide range of system and application software tools. These facilities enable a complete research and development pipeline from front-end sensing design, communication protocols and system development, intelligent information processing, cloud platform construction, to cybersecurity defense.

Moreover, the team actively collaborates with prominent universities and research institutions domestically and internationally, fostering academic exchanges and joint research initiatives. It is committed to cultivating high-level innovative talents and advancing technological innovation and industrial development within related fields.
